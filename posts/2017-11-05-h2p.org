title: Announcing h2p
---

This past week I released [[https://github.com/Bogdanp/h2p][h2p]], a simple python frontend to
[[https://wkhtmltopdf.org][libwkhtmltox]] that lets you generate PDF files from web pages
without needing to spawn subprocesses.

You can use pip or pipenv to install it:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  pipenv install h2p
#+END_SRC

And the API is straightforward:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import h2p

  websites = ["https://google.com", "https://example.com", "https://defn.io"]

  tasks = []
  for i, website in enumerate(websites, 1):
      filename = f"output-{i}.pdf"
      tasks.append(h2p.generate_pdf(filename, website))
      print(f"Enqueued task for {website!r} -> {filename!r}.")

  # ... do other stuff while your pdfs are being generated ...

  for task in tasks:
      task.result()

  print("All tasks are done.")
#+END_SRC

Each call to =generate_pdf= returns an asynchronous task that
represents the action of generating that pdf.  Calling =result= on
that task will block until it's done.
