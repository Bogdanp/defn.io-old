You've reached Bogdan Popa's personal website.  Welcome!

I've been working as a professional software engineer for the past 6
years.  In that time span I have worked on a variety of problems
ranging from low-level video streaming on mobile devices to real time
analytics, device fingerprinting and landing page optimization.

I currently work at [Leadpages][lp] as a Principal Engineer. In my
free time I contribute to and maintain various open source projects
which you can find [here](/projects.html) and on [my GitHub page][gh].

If you want to get in touch, [email][em] me, or send me
an [encrypted message][kb].  Find out about new posts by subscribing
to the [Atom][feed] feed.
