You've reached Bogdan's personal website. Welcome!

I've been working as a professional software engineer for the past 5
years. In that time span I have worked on a variety of problems
ranging from low-level video streaming to real time analytics, device
fingerprinting and landing page optimization.

I currently work at [[https://leadpages.net][LeadPages]] as a Principal Engineer.

In my free time I contribute to and maintain various open source
projects which you can find on [[https://github.com/Bogdanp][my Github page]].

If you want to get in touch, [[mailto:bogdan@defn.io][e-mail]] me.
